# 1. Introduction
Hello hello.
## 1.1 Background
I'm going to write a bunch of stuff in here to see how it renders. Going to add more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more characters to test it.

## 1.2 Purpose

## 1.3 Hypotheses
Here are my hypotheses:

### 1.3.1 Hypothesis 1
This is my first hypothesis

### 1.3.2 Hypothesis 2
This is my second hypothesis

### 1.3.3 Hypothesis 3
This is my third hypothesis

# 2. Basic outline
This is the basic outline for the text.

## 2.1 Examples of click-backs
You can refer back to parts of the article by [clicking here to jump back to the introduction](#1-introduction).

## 2.2 Equations

We can type _equations_ like so: $$e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$$.

If we type an equation on its own line, __it automatically centers itself__:

$$ f(x) = 3x^{2}+1 $$

Notice how I also added _italicized_ and __bold font__.

## 2.3 Lists

Lists are easy.

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

## 2.4 Code
We can insert a generic code block like this
```python
import numpy as np
```
