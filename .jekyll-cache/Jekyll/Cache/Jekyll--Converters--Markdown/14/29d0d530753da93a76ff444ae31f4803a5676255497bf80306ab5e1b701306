<h2 id="22-equations">2.2 Equations</h2>

<p>We can type <em>equations</em> like so: \(e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}\).</p>

<p>If we type an equation on its own line, <strong>it automatically centers itself</strong>:</p>

\[f(x) = 3x^{2}+1\]

<p>Notice how I also added <em>italicized</em> and <strong>bold font</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="23-lists">2.3 Lists</h2>

<p>Lists are easy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24-code">2.4 Code</h2>
<p>We can insert a generic code block like this</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import numpy as np
</code></pre></div></div>
